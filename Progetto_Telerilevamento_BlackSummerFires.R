# Analyzing the vegetation loss in the area of the Blue Mountains in Australia following the fires of 2019-2020 and the following recovery.
# I am suing the BAI (Burnt Area Index) and NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio) to quantify the amount of lost vegetation. 
#Then I am monitoring the recovery of the area using the same methods.

#----------------------------------------------------PHASE 1: STARTING THE PROJECT---------------------------------------------------#
# First to start working in RStudio I need to load the packages (i.e. groups of functions) that are going to be used in this project
# I do this using the function "library()". 
# I already had all these packages installed by the time I started this project but if needed a package can be downloaded like shown in the following exaple
# install.packages("package name here")

library(terra)                             # Spatial data analysis.
library(ggplot2)                           # Creating statistical data visualization.
library(imageRy)                           # Images management, sharing and editing.
library(raster)                            # Geographic data analysis.
library(patchwork)                         # Composing plots created with ggplot2 into a single visualization.
library(viridis)                           # Producing colorblind-friendly color maps.

# Then I'm setting the working directory to the directory. This is the place where RStudio can find the materials I need for the project and where exported files and productions will be saved into
                                           # Starting the project by setting and calling the working directory containing all the data that are going to be used from here on
setwd("C:/Users/HP/Documents/EsameDuccio") # this function sets the path R has to take to access the data
getwd()                                    # this function prints the name of the working directory I'm in. I do this to make sure that everything is at it should be

#----------------------------------------------------PHASE 2: IMPORTING DATA-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# Using the function "raster()" I can import images into RStudio in the form of spatial raster
 # Importing false color images to see what we are working with
pre<-rast("prefirefalseflip1.jpg")      # Importing a .jpg image and turning it into a spatial raster
post<-rast("postfirefalseflip1.jpg")    # Importing a .jpg image and turning it into a spatial raster
                                        # Issue 1: while importing a .jpg, the plot would come out flipped on the x axis.
                                        #          I tried solving this with functions already existing in R but it wouldn't work.
                                        #          At the end of the day I fixed this problem by flipping the image myself before importing it into R studio.
# Plotting each image individually with the function "plot()"

plot(pre)   # plotting the pre-fire image
plot(post)  # plotting the post-fire image
print(pre)  # displaying all the information about the imported image
print(post) # displaying all the information about the imported image
# # This is the result of the print
# class       : SpatRaster 
# dimensions  : 1007, 2500, 3  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)
# resolution  : 1, 1  (x, y)

#   source      : prefirefalseflip1.jpg 
# colors RGB  : 1, 2, 3 
# names       : prefirefalseflip1_1, prefirefalseflip1_2, prefirefalseflip1_3 

# Plotting the two images side by side to see the difference using the function "par()" 
conf_pre_post_fire <- par(mfrow=c(1,2))

dev.off()   # closing all plots generated so far to let my old clunky computer breath a bit

# Importing and grouping each band into a single object
# This is an alternative way to importing the already-made false colour image

## This time I'm using .tiff files instead of .jpg for a few different reasons.
##  They preserve geo-spatial metadata (such as coordinate system)
##  They work with 16 bits rather than 8 per pixel, this allows for more precision 
##  They do not suffer quality loss unlike .jpg files
##  More bands are available, especially NIR and SWIR that are going to be used for this exercise

#----------------------------------------------------PHASE 3:QUANTIFYING THE EXTENT OF THE BURNED AREA---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# In order to quantify the extent of the burnt area two approaches can be taken. The first one is using the Burned Area Index (BAI).
# This approach uses the red and NIR bands. Burned vegetation looses chlorophyll, this causes an increase in reflectance for red and decrease for NIR.
# BAI emphasizes this difference and makes burned areas easier to see. An high value of BAI indicates a most likely burned area
# The second approach is called Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). Similarly to the BAI this method uses the reflectance of NIR and SWIR bands to identify burned areas.
# Lower NBR values represent burned areas. Furthermore by calculating the differential NBR it is possible to get an esteem of the damage
# 1) Burned Area Index (BAI) = ((red-0.1)^2+(nir-0.06^2))/(red+nir)^2 
# 2) Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) = (nir-swir)/(nir+swir)


#--------------------------------------------------BAI & NIR FUNCTIONS-------------------------------

# I am writing two functions to calculate the BAI and NIR and resample the two raster if they have have different resolution
# Higher values represent burnt areas
# Problem: this method might prove inefficient since it can produce false positives in shady areas

# Function to calculate the BAI with automatic resampling integrated
